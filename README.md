I've converted a bunch of SVG files of the provinces of South Africa to be able to use them and glyphs or fonts in your HTML/CSS projects

Open *demo.html* to see a list of all the glyphs in your font along with their codes/ligatures.

You won't need any of the files located under the *demo-files* directory when including the generated font in your own projects.
